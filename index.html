    <h2>Coursework</h2>
    <p>Along with my full-time courseload at Menlo-Atherton, I've scratched my intellectual itch through university-level, seminar-style courses at Stanford Online High School for the past few years. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
    <ul class="list-arrows">
        <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java</strong>, built a program that optimizes cable from cell towers to consumer homes to increase speeds of emergency calls, a spell checker program that includes suggestions for words (similar to autofill), a program that optimizes power lines between power sources and homes, and many more</li>
        <li><strong>The Study of the Mind: Psychology, Neuroscience, and Philosophy</strong>, debated the relationship between free will and moral responsibility, learned about how incredible (sometimes too incredible) our brains are</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Topics in Microeconomics</strong>, read a lot of econ papers, wrote my own 13-page paper on the microeconomics of Bitcoin, and learned that humans are irrational more often than we realize</li>
        <li><strong>Linear Algebra and Differential Equations</strong>, did a lot of integrals and derivatives</li>
    </ul>
